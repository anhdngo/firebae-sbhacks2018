## Description
A buyer privacy securing ecommerce storefront and backend built entirely in and around the Firebase ecosystem.
We decided to forcefully constrain ourselves to use only Firebase and their products for two reasons.
We wanted to figure out how robust Firebase could be and learn new technology that we were previously unfamiliar with.
